### 1.1 Functional Testing

Functional testing verifies that the application behaves according to **business requirements and functional specifications**.

#### 📖 Definition

Testing the **"what"** of the application—what features does it provide and do they work correctly?

#### 🎯 Focus Areas:

- ✅ **Input validation** - Correct handling of user inputs
- ✅ **Business logic** - Rules and workflows execute correctly
- ✅ **User workflows** - End-to-end scenarios complete successfully
- ✅ **System responses** - Expected outputs for given inputs
- ✅ **Error handling** - Graceful handling of invalid operations

#### 💡 Examples:

**Login Functionality:**
```
✓ User can log in with valid credentials
✓ User is blocked with invalid credentials
✓ Password masking works correctly
✓ "Forgot Password" link navigates properly
✓ Account locks after 3 failed attempts
```

**E-commerce Cart:**
```
✓ Items can be added to cart
✓ Quantity can be updated
✓ Items can be removed
✓ Cart total calculates correctly
✓ Free shipping applied when threshold met
```

#### 🔍 When to Perform:

- After new features are developed
- During sprint testing
- Before regression testing
- As part of UAT

---

### 1.2 Regression Testing

Regression testing ensures that **existing functionalities continue to work correctly** after changes.

#### 📖 Definition

Testing to verify that recent code changes haven't adversely affected existing features.

#### 🎯 Triggers for Regression Testing:

- 🆕 **New feature additions** - Ensure integrations don't break old features
- 🐛 **Bug fixes** - Verify fix doesn't introduce new issues
- 🔄 **Code refactoring** - Confirm behavior remains unchanged
- ⚙️ **Configuration changes** - Validate system still works correctly
- 🔌 **Third-party updates** - Check compatibility with library upgrades

#### 💡 Strategy:

    I --> F
    
    style C fill:#ffcccc
    style H fill:#d4edda
    style I fill:#f8d7da
```

> [!TIP]
> Regression testing is repetitive in nature and is a **strong candidate for automation**. Automate stable, frequently-run regression tests to save time.

#### 📊 Best Practices:

| Practice | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Prioritize test cases** | Critical features first, then medium, then low priority |
| **Maintain test suite** | Remove obsolete tests, update for requirement changes |
| **Automate where possible** | Reduce manual effort for repetitive tests |
| **Track coverage** | Ensure all critical paths are tested |

---

### 1.3 Smoke Testing

Smoke testing is a **shallow and wide** test performed to verify that **critical functionalities** of a build are working.

#### 📖 Definition

A quick, broad test to check if the "house is on fire" (critical failures exist).

#### 🎯 Objective:

Verify that the build is **stable enough** for detailed testing.

#### ⏱️ Performed When:

- 🏗️ A new build is deployed
- 🔄 Before detailed testing begins
- 🚀 After environment setup
- 📦 Before release to QA team

#### ✅ Outcome:

```
Pass → Proceed with detailed testing
Fail → Reject the build (send back to development)
```

#### 💡 Example Smoke Test Suite:

**E-commerce Application:**
```markdown
1. ✓ Application launches successfully
2. ✓ Homepage loads without errors
3. ✓ User can log in
4. ✓ Product search returns results
5. ✓ Product can be added to cart
6. ✓ Checkout page loads
7. ✓ Order can be placed
8. ✓ User can log out
```

**Duration:** Typically 15-30 minutes for manual execution

---

### 1.4 Sanity Testing

Sanity testing is a **focused and narrow** test performed after minor changes to verify that a **specific functionality or bug fix** works as expected.

#### 📖 Definition

A quick check to ensure a specific functionality works correctly after a change.

#### 🎯 Objective:

Verify that the **targeted fix or feature** works without breaking related functionality.

#### 💡 Example:

**Bug Fix:** "Login button remained disabled after entering valid credentials"

**Sanity Test:**
```markdown
1. Navigate to login page
2. Enter valid credentials
3. ✓ Verify button becomes enabled
4. Click login button
5. ✓ Verify successful login
6. ✓ Verify related logout functionality still works
```

---

### 1.5 Smoke vs Sanity Comparison

| Aspect | Smoke Testing | Sanity Testing |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| **Scope** | Broad (entire application) | Narrow (specific feature) |
| **Depth** | Shallow | Focused |
| **Purpose** | Build stability verification | Specific fix verification |
| **Performed By** | Developers or QA | QA Team |
| **Documentation** | May be documented | Usually undocumented |
| **When** | New build deployment | After bug fix or minor change |
| **Example** | Test all major features briefly | Test only the fixed login issue |

    style A fill:#e1f5ff
    style B fill:#fff3cd
    style C fill:#fff3cd
    style D fill:#fff3cd
    style E fill:#fff3cd
```

### 📖 Overview

Black box testing focuses on **testing the system without knowledge of internal code or implementation**. Test cases are derived from **requirements and specifications**.

---

### 2.1 Equivalence Partitioning (EP)

#### 📖 Concept

Divide input data into **equivalence classes** where all values in a class should behave similarly. Test **one representative value from each partition**.

#### 🎯 Benefits:

- ✅ **Reduces test cases** - From thousands to manageable numbers
- ✅ **Maintains coverage** - Still tests all scenarios effectively
- ✅ **Improves efficiency** - Less time, same quality

#### 💡 Example 1: Age Field Validation

**Requirement:** Valid age range is `18–60`

**Equivalence Classes:**

| Partition | Range | Type | Test Values | Expected Result |
|-----------|-------|------|-------------|-----------------|
| P1 | age < 18 | Invalid | 10, 15, 17 | ❌ Error message |
| P2 | 18 ≤ age ≤ 60 | Valid | 25, 40, 55 | ✅ Accepted |
| P3 | age > 60 | Invalid | 65, 80, 100 | ❌ Error message |

**Test Cases:**
```
TC-EP-01: Enter age = 15 → Expected: Error "Age must be 18-60"
TC-EP-02: Enter age = 30 → Expected: Age accepted
TC-EP-03: Enter age = 70 → Expected: Error "Age must be 18-60"
```

#### 💡 Example 2: Discount Code

**Requirement:**
- `SAVE10` → 10% discount
- `SAVE20` → 20% discount
- Other codes → Invalid

**Equivalence Classes:**
```
Valid Class 1: SAVE10
Valid Class 2: SAVE20
Invalid Class: Any other string
```

---

### 2.2 Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)

#### 📖 Concept

Test values at the **boundaries** of input ranges, where defects are most likely to occur.

#### 🎯 Why Boundaries?

Developers often make mistakes in boundary conditions:
- Off-by-one errors
- Incorrect comparison operators (`<` vs `<=`)
- Edge case handling

#### 🔍 BVA Rule:

For range `[min, max]`, test:
- **min - 1** (just below minimum)
- **min** (minimum boundary)
- **min + 1** (just above minimum)
- **max - 1** (just below maximum)
- **max** (maximum boundary)
- **max + 1** (just above maximum)

#### 💡 Example: Password Length (8-16 characters)

| Test Case | Length | Input | Expected Result |
|-----------|--------|-------|-----------------|
| TC-BVA-01 | 7 | Test@12 | ❌ Error: "Min 8 chars" |
| TC-BVA-02 | 8 | Test@123 | ✅ Valid |
| TC-BVA-03 | 9 | Test@1234 | ✅ Valid |
| TC-BVA-04 | 15 | Test@1234567890 | ✅ Valid |
| TC-BVA-05 | 16 | Test@12345678901 | ✅ Valid |
| TC-BVA-06 | 17 | Test@123456789012 | ❌ Error: "Max 16 chars" |

---

### 2.3 Decision Table Testing

#### 📖 Concept

Use a **decision table** to capture complex business rules involving multiple conditions and corresponding actions.

#### 🎯 Best Suited For:

- Complex business logic
- Multiple input combinations
- Different outcomes based on condition combinations

#### 💡 Example: Loan Approval System

**Business Rules:**
```
Loan approved if:
- Income ≥ $50,000 AND
- Credit Score ≥ 700
```

**Decision Table:**

| Rule | R1 | R2 | R3 | R4 |
|------|----|----|----|----|
| **Conditions** |
| Income ≥ $50K | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| Credit ≥ 700 | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Actions** |
| Approve Loan | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Reject Loan | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Rejection Reason | - | Low Credit | Low Income | Both Insufficient |

**Derived Test Cases:**
```
TC-DT-01 (R1): Income=$60K, Credit=750 → Approved
TC-DT-02 (R2): Income=$60K, Credit=650 → Rejected (Low Credit)
TC-DT-03 (R3): Income=$40K, Credit=750 → Rejected (Low Income)
TC-DT-04 (R4): Income=$40K, Credit=650 → Rejected (Both)
```

---

### 2.4 State Transition Testing

#### 📖 Concept

Test **state changes** triggered by events or actions in systems where behavior depends on current state.

#### 🎯 When to Use:

- User account states
- Order processing workflows
- Application menu navigation
- Session management

#### 💡 Example: User Account States

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Inactive: Account Created
    Inactive --> Active: Email Verified
    Active --> Locked: 3 Failed Logins
    Locked --> Active: 15 Min Timeout
    Active --> Suspended: Admin Action
    Suspended --> Active: Admin Reactivate
    Active --> Deleted: User Deletes
    Deleted --> [*]
```

**Test Cases:**

| Test ID | Current State | Event | Expected New State |
|---------|---------------|-------|-------------------|
| TC-ST-01 | Inactive | Verify Email | Active |
| TC-ST-02 | Active | 3 Failed Logins | Locked |
| TC-ST-03 | Locked | Wait 15 Minutes | Active |
| TC-ST-04 | Active | Admin Suspends | Suspended |
| TC-ST-05 | Suspended | Admin Reactivates | Active |

**Invalid Transitions (Negative Testing):**
```
TC-ST-NEG-01: Inactive → Locked (should not be possible)
TC-ST-NEG-02: Deleted → Active (should not be possible)
```

|--------|----------|----------|
| **Perspective** | Technical team | Business/Product team |
| **Measures** | Impact on system | Urgency for users |
| **Determined By** | QA/Developers | Product Manager/Stakeholders |
| **Question** | How bad is the impact? | How soon must it be fixed? |
| **Can Change?** | Rarely | Often (based on business needs) |

> [!NOTE]
> **Severity** is typically set by QA based on technical impact. **Priority** is often adjusted by Product/Business teams based on customer impact and business goals.

---

## 6️⃣ Test Coverage

### 📖 Definition

Test coverage measures **how much of the application** is tested.

### 📊 Types of Coverage:

```mermaid
mindmap
  root((Test<br/>Coverage))
    Requirements
      Functional Coverage
      User Story Coverage
    Code
      Line Coverage
      Branch Coverage
      Path Coverage
    Features
      Feature Coverage
      Module Coverage
```

### 🎯 Coverage Metrics:

| Metric | Formula | Target | Notes |
|--------|---------|--------|-------|
| **Requirement Coverage** | (Requirements Tested / Total Requirements) × 100 | 100% | Critical for UAT |
| **Feature Coverage** | (Features Tested / Total Features) × 100 | 90%+ | Prioritize critical features |
| **Test Case Execution** | (Executed Tests / Total Tests) × 100 | 100% | Before release |
| **Defect Coverage** | (Defects Found / Total Defects) × 100 | Unknown | Estimate using sampling |

> [!WARNING]
> **100% coverage ≠ 100% quality**. Coverage measures breadth, not depth. Quality testing requires both coverage AND thorough test design.

## 7️⃣ Testing Principles

### 📜 Seven Principles of Software Testing

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[1. Testing shows presence of defects] --> H[ISTQB Testing<br/>Principles]
    B[2. Exhaustive testing is impossible] --> H
    C[3. Early testing saves time and money] --> H
    D[4. Defects cluster together] --> H
    E[5. Pesticide paradox] --> H
    F[6. Testing is context-dependent] --> H
    G[7. Absence-of-errors fallacy] --> H
    
    style H fill:#e1f5ff
```

#### 1️⃣ Testing Shows Presence of Defects

Testing can prove defects exist, but **cannot prove they don't exist**.

#### 2️⃣ Exhaustive Testing is Impossible

Testing every combination is impractical. Use **risk-based prioritization**.

#### 3️⃣ Early Testing Saves Time and Money

**Shift-left testing** - find bugs early when they're cheaper to fix.

#### 4️⃣ Defects Cluster Together

**Pareto principle:** 80% of defects come from 20% of modules. Focus testing accordingly.

#### 5️⃣ Pesticide Paradox

Repeating same tests won't find new bugs. **Regularly review and update test cases**.

#### 6️⃣ Testing is Context-Dependent

Different applications need different testing approaches (e-commerce ≠ medical device).

#### 7️⃣ Absence-of-Errors Fallacy

Bug-free software that doesn't meet user needs is useless. **Test for business value**.

## 🧠 Best Practices

### ✅ DO:

- ✔️ **Understand requirements thoroughly** before testing
- ✔️ **Create test cases early** (during requirement phase)
- ✔ **Focus on critical paths** first
- ✔️ **Test negative scenarios** (error handling)
- ✔️ **Document test results** clearly
- ✔️ **Reproduce bugs consistently** before logging
- ✔️ **Communicate with developers** professionally
- ✔️ **Update test cases** when requirements change
- ✔️ **Prioritize based on risk** and impact
- ✔️ **Learn from production defects** and improve tests

### ❌ DON'T:

- ✖️ **Don't test without understanding requirements**
- ✖️ **Don't only test happy paths** (positive scenarios)
- ✖️ **Don't skip exploratory testing**
- ✖️ **Don't log bugs without reproducible steps**
- ✖️ **Don't blame developers** for bugs
- ✖️ **Don't assume automation replaces manual testing**
- ✖️ **Don't ignore edge cases**
- ✖️ **Don't test in production** (unless specifically allowed)

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Why It's Bad | Solution |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| **Testing without requirements** | Unclear acceptance criteria | Always review requirements first |
| **Only testing happy paths** | Misses majority of real-world issues | For each positive test, write 2-3 negative tests |
| **Skipping documentation** | Can't reproduce or track issues | Document all test cases and defects |
| **Not retesting fixes** | Bugs reappear in production | Always verify fixes before closing bugs |
| **Ignoring environment differences** | "Works on my machine" syndrome | Test in environment matching production |
| **Testing too late** | Expensive fixes | Shift-left: test early and often |
| **100% coverage goal** | Wastes time on low-value tests | Prioritize based on risk and business value |
